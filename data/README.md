This folder is used for data storage. This folder must be present for running SegnoSharp "out-of-the-box" from a cloned repository,
and this README.MD file ensures that. Any other files put into this folder will be ignored by Git.

See the [prerequisites](https://segnosharp.readthedocs.io/latest/quickstart.html#prerequisites) in the documentation for instructions on how to use this folder.
