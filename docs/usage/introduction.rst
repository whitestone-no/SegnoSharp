Introduction

This section of the documentation is intended to give a detailed look at each module in SegnoSharp
so that you will understand what each function in the module does, and if it does have anything happening
behind the scenes that you should be aware of.

SegnoSharp comes with 8 preinstalled modules, and you can add your own if you want to extend the functionality of SegnoSharp.
See the :ref:`Extending > Modules<_refExtendingModules>` chapter for details on how to do this.
