This shows information from the BASS libraries.

It will show the registration information, if it has been filled in. See :ref:`Configuration <refConfigurationBass>`.

It will also show the version numbers of the loaded BASS libraries.

.. note:: The ``BASSFLAC`` library is not listed. This is because there is no method in the library to retrieve this information.
